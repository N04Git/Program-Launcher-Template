A template for an Application Launcher that runs in python

This was written with MacOS in mind, however it will run in Windows and Linux as well.

> **!!! Python is not preinstalled on Windows, so you will have to install it yourself !!!**
<br>
To run, either run gui.py in your Python Interpreter or use the command "python3 gui.py" (MacOS/Windows) or "python gui.py" (Linux) in your terminal (in the same directory as this project)
